# The_Runner_Prototype
This Unity project is an Action game, and is a part of create with code 2 course on Unity.

The Gameplay is simple: use 'Spacebar' (once or twice for double jump) to jump over the obstacles, and 'left SHIFT' to double the speed.

Some Concepts I learned and tested on this prototype are: randomize obstacles, double jump, Dash ability and game start animation.

This project was created on Unity 2021.3.0f1 and built-in render pipeline.
